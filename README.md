# Comments-Analyzer
Comments-Analyzer is a website aimed at analyzing comments made on reddit posts. What happens is the user provides the website with a post URL, then Comments-Analyzer then scrapes
the comments from the aformentioned post and then return with an analysis of of all the comments within that particuler post. 

CURRENT VERSION: 1.0

## V 1.0

So the plan here is to give the option to use either model to predict.
