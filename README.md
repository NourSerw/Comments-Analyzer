# Comments Analyzer
Comments-Analyzer is a website aimed at analyzing comments made on reddit posts. What happens is the user provides the website with a post URL, then Comments-Analyzer then scrapes
the comments from the aformentioned post and then return with an analysis of of all the comments within that particuler post. 

**CURRENT VERSION: 1.2**

## V 1.0
**1.1**:  There are two models at the moment: The general model and the news-tailored model. Now only the general model has been implemented but the second model has already been built. So the plan here is to give the option to use either model to predict.

**1.2**: I have added a third model called "Football". There is a simnple HTML dropdown list where the user can choose which model to predict with depending on the type of subreddit post it is.
